ABC INSURANCE COMPANY
As of 2016, there were over 268 million registered vehicles on the roads in the United States. In 2015, there were 32,166 fatalities, 1,715,000 injuries and 4,548,000 car crashes which involved property damage. So, while many of us feel secure in our vehicles, the statistics indicate the importance of automobile insurance and in most cases, auto insurance is required by law. Auto insurance is important because it not only covers any physical damage that may occur in an accident, but also any damage or injury that might be caused because of a vehicular accident or which may be done upon oneself or one’s vehicle by another vehicle or accident – a falling tree for example(Car insurance in the U.S. - Statistics & Facts)
The Insurance industry is immensely data intensive. Historically, their data has been largely fragmented and underutilized.  Also, insurance industry goes through a lot of combining structured and unstructured data, which enables the industry to generate powerful insights. With an incredible amount of data flowing in from multiple new digital channels, the insurance industry is undergoing a paradigm shift in the way they function – right from product planning to pricing, introduction, marketing, customer self-service and claim processing.
The objective of this project is to build a “Risk Analytics model” to understand the renewal potential and claim propensity of Existing Customers under Personal Auto Insurance Lines. 

The question to answer is:
Will the policy holder initiate a claim (Yes/No) for this policy in the next policy year?
